B) Analyze the signal
   
   
   Based on the picture above, we get an X signal and  Y signal. Where signal y is denser than signal X. if we combine the two signals, the z signal is formed which has an irregular shape.



C) Analyze the audio audio Z
   
   
   From the results of the experiments we have done, we found that the sound produced is a bit harsh and noisy. this happens because the shape of the signal is irregular so that there is noise.
